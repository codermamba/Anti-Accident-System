This was a smart car idea that targetted at the challenge of driver falling asleep while driving   
<br>
This system had three highlights to it
<br>    * Sleep detection steering
<br>    * Smart Indicator
<br>    * Anti Collision system
<br>
This system was presented in a lot of hackathon by me and my team.
